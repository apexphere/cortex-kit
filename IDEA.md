I want to build a AI-native project boiler plate tool. As I was creating a lot of such projects, every time I have to create agents.md etc on the fly.

This tool should be deployable, I can install it via npm.

This tool should use single command to init an AI-native project with proper agents definitions, development workflow, etc. For example, but not limited to: write unit testing, integration testing and e2e testing. Always do dev testing after work done. Write architecture designs in docs/ folder. 

I want to start simple, first version should be runable from end to end, create only simple basic things.

Think about it, let me know what's in your mind.
